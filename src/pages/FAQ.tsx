    {
      id: 'how-qr-works',
      category: 'general',
      question: 'How do QR codes work?',
      answer: 'QR codes (Quick Response) are two-dimensional barcodes that can store information like URLs, text, contacts, etc. When scanned with a smartphone camera, the device can automatically read and process the encoded information, taking the user to a website, saving a contact, or executing another specific action.'
    },
    {
      id: 'qr-types-available',
      category: 'general',

    },
    {
      id: 'device-compatibility',
      category: 'general',

    // Static vs Dynamic
    {
      id: 'static-vs-dynamic',
      category: 'types',
      question: 'What\'s the difference between static and dynamic QR codes?',
      answer: 'Static QR codes have information encoded directly in the visual pattern and cannot be modified after creation, but work forever without depending on servers. Dynamic codes redirect through a short URL that you can change anytime, include complete analytics, but require internet connection and depend on our servers.'
    },
    {
      id: 'when-use-static',
      category: 'types',
      question: 'When should I use static QR codes?',
      answer: 'Static codes are ideal for: information that won\'t change (like contact data, WiFi credentials, fixed locations), when you need maximum scan speed, for offline use or places without reliable internet, and when you want permanent operation guarantee without depending on external services.'
    },
    {
      id: 'when-use-dynamic',
      category: 'types',
      question: 'When should I use dynamic QR codes?',
      answer: 'Dynamic codes are perfect for: marketing campaigns where you need to change destinations, when you want detailed scan analytics, temporary promotions, frequently changing menus, events with updatable information, and any case where you need flexibility to edit content after printing.'
    },

    // Pricing and Plans
    {
      id: 'free-plan-limits',
      category: 'pricing',
      question: 'What does the free plan include?',

    },
    {
      id: 'plan-differences',
      category: 'pricing',
      question: 'What are the differences between paid plans?',
      answer: 'Basic Plan ($7/month): Unlimited static QRs, 10 dynamic, complete customization, multiple formats. Professional Plan ($15/month): Everything above + 100 dynamic, advanced analytics, 5 users. Business Plan (contact): 1,000 dynamic, 20 users, full API, dedicated support.'

      category: 'pricing',
      question: 'Do you offer discounts for annual payment?',

      id: 'cancellation-policy',
      category: 'pricing',
      question: 'What happens if I cancel my subscription?',
      answer: 'You can cancel anytime without penalties. Static QR codes will continue working forever. Dynamic codes will continue working for an additional 30 days after cancellation, giving you time to migrate or upgrade your plan.'
