## Smart Translation Strategy

### Option 1: Translate Critical Pages Now (Recommended)
**I'll translate these for you right now:**
- Dashboard (30 min)
- Create QR (20 min)
- FAQ (15 min - it's mostly static Q&A)

**You can translate later:**
- Features, Profile, Contact (similar patterns)
- Legal pages (many sites leave these in English)

**Total time: ~1 hour**
**Coverage: 90% of user interactions**

### Option 2: Use AI Translation Tool
For remaining pages, you can:
1. Extract all text from English pages
2. Use ChatGPT/Claude to translate
3. I'll show you the format to paste into JSON files
4. Takes 5-10 minutes per page

### Option 3: Professional Translation (Best Quality)
- Hire translator on Fiverr ($50-100 for all pages)
- Provide them the JSON files
- Get culturally appropriate translations
- Do this post-launch based on user feedback

## My Recommendation

**Launch Strategy:**
1. **I translate Dashboard + Create + FAQ** (critical user pages) - 1 hour
2. **You launch!** 🚀
3. **Post-launch:** Translate remaining pages based on:
   - Which pages users visit most (check GA4)
   - Which languages users prefer (check analytics)
   - User feedback/requests

**Why?**
- 90% of user interactions will be translated
- You can launch sooner
- Learn from real users what's needed
- Perfect is enemy of done!

## What Should We Do?

**Option A:** I translate Dashboard, Create, FAQ now (~1 hour)

- You can launch with confidence
- Add rest later

**Option B:** I translate ALL remaining pages (~3-4 hours)
- Everything 100% translated
- Launch with complete i18n
- Takes longer

**Option C:** I show you the pattern + template
